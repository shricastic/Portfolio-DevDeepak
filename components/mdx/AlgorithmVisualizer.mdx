## Key Features

### 1. Bar Visualization

- **Dynamic Sorting Bars:** Watch as the app visually represents the sorting process using dynamic bars. Each bar represents a data element, and you can witness the sorting algorithm in action as the bars rearrange themselves in real-time.

- **Color-Coded Representation:** The bars are color-coded to highlight the current state of the sorting process, making it easy for users to track and understand each step.

### 2. Supported Sorting Algorithms

The SortingVisualizer app supports a comprehensive list of popular sorting algorithms, including:

- **Bubble Sort**
- **Selection Sort**
- **Count Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- **Quick Sort**

### 3. Tree Visualization

In addition to bar visualization, the app introduces tree visualization for sorting algorithms that utilize tree-based structures.

Users can switch between bar and tree visualizations to gain a deeper insight into the inner workings of these algorithms.

### 4. User-Friendly Interface

The app boasts a clean and user-friendly interface, ensuring a seamless experience for users of all skill levels. The intuitive controls allow users to start, pause, and reset the sorting process at any time.

### 5. Customization Options

- **Adjustable Speed:** Users can control the speed of the sorting algorithm, allowing for a slow and deliberate observation or a fast-paced demonstration.

- **Array Size Control:** Change the size of the dataset to observe how algorithms behave with varying amounts of data.

- **Custom Audio:** Personalize your sorting experience by changing the audio that plays during different sorting processes. Choose from a selection of sounds to enhance your visualization experience.

## How to Use

1. **Select Algorithm:** Choose from the list of supported sorting algorithms.
2. **Adjust Settings:** Customize parameters such as speed and array size according to your preference.
3. **Visualize Sorting:** Click the `Start` button to see the sorting algorithm in action. Pause and reset options are available for more control.

## Why Use SortingVisualizer?

- **Educational Tool:** Ideal for students and educators to visualize and comprehend sorting algorithms effectively.

- **Developer's Aid:** Perfect for developers who want a quick and visual understanding of sorting algorithms during the development process.

- **Algorithm Comparison:** Easily compare the efficiency and performance of different sorting algorithms side by side.
